Sequence Alignment:

This is a respository for storing all the codes related to the Bio-informatics.

1) Match in sequence alignment:
  1.1) Score - Finding Score from 2 DNA sequences
  1.2) DotPlot Matrix - The dot-plot matrix provides a visualization of potential matching of subsequences between any two sequences
  
 2) Codons: (Translation process)
  2.1) START & STOP codon location
  2.2) Amino acid Identification - Finding amino acid for the respective codon
  
 3) Global & Local alignment for DNA sequence:
  3.1) Needleman â€“ Wunsch
  3.2) Smith - Waterman
